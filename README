comp_selftest
=============

This is a Linux kernel module to perform a self-test and benchmarks on in-kernel crypto compression algorithms.

This repository just contains the original code of the module (created by Dan Streetman), buildable as a standalone out-of-tree module, along with very minor fixes. For more information, see https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/7/756

The code is licensed under the GPLv2.
